# Dan's House of Games API!

Welcome to my very own House of Games API, as part of the Northcoders back-end portfolio project!

## SETUP

**.env. files**

In order to be able to clone this repository and run it locally as it's intended, you'll need to create your own .env. files in the project's main directory:

**`.env.development`**

Populate `.env.development` with the following:

```
PGDATABASE=nc_games
```

**`.env.test`**

Populate `.env.test` with the following:

```
PGDATABASE=nc_games_test
```
